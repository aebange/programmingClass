## Objectives
1. Define the basics of understanding and using the Python (3) programming language

### How and why Python works
-  **The interpreter:**  takes the text from a Python program file (.py) and decodes the contained Python statements (from the top of the file to the bottom) into commands that it then executes. 
-  **Byte code:** is created when a Python program file is executed. The commands contained inside of the file are compiled into this lower level platform-independent representation by decomposing them into individual steps. This is done to increase the speed of the program's execution as Byte code can be read and executed faster than raw Python source code.
    - Byte code can be generally found in a subdirectory called ``__pycache__`` located within the same directory as their source files. 
    - Whenever the Python program file is updated, it's corresponding Byte code file(s) are also rewritten to contain the new changes.
    - Because python uses Byte code, **there is no need to build or make a program before it's execution.**
    - If the system fails to compile a Byte code file, the program will still successfully execute, however the process will take place at a slower pace since a new Byte code file will need to be created each time the program is run. 
-  **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**: The massive loop of code that makes up the runtime engine of python. The PVM is the "final step" of the Python interpreter.
-  **Iterable Objects:** An object is iterable if it is physically stored in sequence in memory or an object that generates one item at a time.

### General concepts to understand
-  **Methods:** Functions that are attached to and act upon a specific object and are called with an expression
    - `S = 'Spam'`, `S.find(pa) >> 1 `('find' is the method and it works on strings)
-  **Getting help:** Whenever curious about a function or method, simply type help(x.function) to see the syntax in the interpreter. Results will vary depending on the object type of the variable used.
    - `S = [1,2,3,"four]`, `help(S.insert)`
-  **Nesting:** Objects of any type can be nested within each other. So lists can be nested in lists can be nested in dictionaries can be nested in lists. 
    - `L = [1,2,3,4]`, `X = ["A","B","C"]`, `L.append(X) >>> L >>> [1,2,3,4,["A","B","C"]]`
-  **Sequences vs Mappings:** Sequences store items and information based on relative position, whereas mappings store information based on keys.
-  **Garbage Collection:** Data that is no longer being used or referenced is deleted.
    - `x = (1,2,3)`, `x >>> (1,2,3)`, `x = 0`, `x >>> 0` (The (1,2,3) was deleted since its reference was removed.)
-  **Statement blocks:** When creating a statement that contains multiple items, Python automatically detects the indentation on the block and deduces what commands are part of the statement.
### Python Data Types
-  **Numbers:**
    - Integer (int(x)): Whole numbers that have no decimals.
        - `1234, 5, -666, 13`
    - Long (long(x)): An integer that is infinite in size
        - `51924361L`
    - Float (float(x)): Numbers that do have decimals.
        - `3.1415, 100.5, -237.0145`
    - Complex (complex(x,y)): All numbers are expressed as a sum of a real part and an imaginary part.
        - `(3+1j)`, `(2+4j)`
-  **Strings:** Text used to contain information as well as arbitrary collections of bytes.
    - Syntax: Single quotes should be used to contain the string, double quotes should be used as normal quotes inside of the string.
        - `S = 'And now for something "completely" different.'`
    - Immutability: Strings are immutable and cannot be overwritten. 
        - `S = 'Spam'`, `S[0] = 'z' >>> ...error text omitted...`
    - Sequence Operations: A word contained in a string acts as though each character is a separate string.
        - `S = 'Spam'`, `len(S) >>> 4`, `S[0] >>> 'S'`, `S[3] >>> 'm'`
    - Importing other objects: Strings can have objects imported into them. These methods must be delimited with a % between the initial string and the imports.
        - %s: Imports a string into the string.
            - `S = ('Your favorite color is %s mixed with %s' % ('blue','red'))`, `S >>> 'Your favorite color is blue mixed with red'`
        - %d: Imports a numerical value.
            - `S = ('Your favorite number is %d added to %d' % (9, 10))`, `Your favorite number is  added to 10'`
-  **Lists:** Positionally ordered collections of arbitrarily typed objects.
    - Syntax: Lists are coded in brackets - NOT in parenthesis.
    - Sequence Operations: Items contained in a list act as though each whole item is separate. 
        - `S = [1, 2, 3, 'pie']`, `S[3] >>> 'pie'`, `len(S) >>> 4`
    - Common Methods:
        - x.append("text"): Adds a single object to the end of a list.
        - x.pop(#): Deletes an object in the specified list offset. 
        - x.insert(#,"text"): Adds a single object to a specified list offset.
        - x.remove("text"): Removes a single specified object.
        - x.sort(): Sorts list items based on alphabetic and numeric order.
        - x.reverse(): Sorts list items in reverse of the format used in list.sort.
    - Bounds checking: Python requires modifications to lists to be made using methods. 
    - Matrix: A two dimensional set of lists contained in a list.
        - `M = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]`
    - Matrix Comprehensions: Ways of retrieving information from a Matrix.
        - `col2 = [row[1] for row in M]`, `col2 >>> [2,5,8]` (creates a "for" loop that collects items from row[1] in M)
        - `row2 = M[1]`, `row2 >>> [1,2,3]`
        - `G = (sum(row))`, `next(G) >>> 6`, `next(G) >>> 15`, `next(G) >>> 24`, `next(G) >>> error` (out of rows)
        - `list(range(4)) >>> [0,1,2,3]`, `list(range{-7,7,2)) >>> [-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6]`
        - `list(map(sum, M)) >> [6, 15, 24]`
        - `(sum(row) for row in M) >>> {24, 6, 15}`
    - Mutability: Lists can be changed and have their data overwritten.
-  **Dictionaries:** A list that stores information based on its relative key rather than its position in the list.
    - Syntax: Dictionaries are coded in curled brackets. 
    - Mutability: Dictionaries can be changed and have their data overwritten.
        - `D = {'quantity': 1, 'money': 2}`, `D['quantity'] +=1`, `D >>> 2`
    - Mapping Operations: Items can be manipulated, called from, and added to the dictionary based on their relative keys.
        - `D = {}` , `D['name'] = 'Bob'`, `D['job'] = "Developer"`, `D['age'] = 40`, `D['age'] += 1`, `D >>> {'name': 'Bob', 'job': 'Developer', 'age': 41}`
        - `bob1 = dict(name='Bob, job='dev', age=40)` (Dictionaries can be forced in this way)
    - Merging Values with their Keys: Lists of keys can be combined into a single dictionary via "Zipping". This process does not order the keys as intended as dictionaries are mappings.
        - `bob2 = dict(zip(['name', 'job', 'age'], ['Bob', 'dev', 40]))`, `bob2 >>> {'name': 'Bob', 'job': 'dev', 'age': 40}`
    - Nested Dictionaries: Because of nesting in Python, dictionaries and lists can be stored within each other. There are particular ways to access data within data.
        - `D = {'name': {'first': 'Bob', 'last': 'Smith'}, 'jobs': ['dev', 'mgr'], 'age' : 40.5}`
        - dict['key']: Calls a key from a dictionary.
            - `D['name'] >>> {'first': 'Bob', 'last': 'Smith'}`
        - dict['key1']['key2']: Calls a key from within a key and can be done infinite times.
            - `D['name']['last'] >>> 'Smith'`
        - dict['key1'].method('item'): Depending on the data type being used, nested items can still have their methods used as long as their keys are called first.
            - `D['jobs'].append('spanish inquisitor')`, `D['jobs'] >>> ('dev, 'mgr', 'spanish inquisitor')` ('jobs' contained list items, allowing the use of the list.append() method)
    - Common Methods:
        - Testing for keys: Python allows the use of conditional statements and booleans to test for existing keys within Dictionary structures. 
            - `D = {'a': 1, 'c' :3, 'b' : 2}`
                - `'f' in D >>> false`
                - `if not 'f' in D: print('missing') >>> missing`
-  **Tuples:** Very similar to a list that cannot be changed.
    - Syntax: Tuples are coded in parenthesis akin to their list counterparts.
    - Immutability: Tuples are immutable and cannot be changed.
    - Methods: Tuples have separate and fewer method options compared to lists.
-  **Files:** A file external of the program that can be used to contain data.
    - Common Methods:
        - `x = open('y.extension', 'w')`: Create and open a new file, the 'w' parameter defines that the file should be written.
        - `x.write('Hello\n')`: Write to the opened file the contained text. 
        - `x.close()`: Closes and flushes output to the file.
        - `x = open('y.extension')`: Reopens the file without writing a new one.
        - `t = f.read()`: Outputs the file's text to the defined variable.     
-  **Sets:**
    - set('abc'),{'a', 'b', 'c'}
-  **Booleans:**
    - True, False
-  **Types:**
